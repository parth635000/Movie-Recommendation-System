# Movie Recommendation System
##NOTE: The deployment link will crash because the the backend exceeds memory and size limits of free serverless platforms such as Vercel.

A comprehensive movie recommendation engine built with Python and Flask, showcasing three distinct collaborative filtering approaches: SVD, KNN, and Deep Learning (Neural Collaborative Filtering).

## Dataset Used
Kaggle 1M MovieLens dataset link- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/odedgolden/movielens-1m-dataset
## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Rate movies directly in the web UI.
- **Multi-Model Support:** Choose between three powerful recommendation algorithms:
    - **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition):** Matrix factorization technique.
    - **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):** User-based collaborative filtering.
    - **Deep Learning:** Neural Collaborative Filtering using Keras/TensorFlow.
- **Real-time Recommendations:** Get instant movie suggestions based on your ratings.
- **Performance Metrics:** View model performance statistics (RMSE, MAE, Precision, Recall).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   *Note: The first run might take a moment to train the models if pre-trained weights are not found.*

2. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

3. **Get Recommendations:**
   - Rate a few movies on the home page.
   - Select a model (SVD, KNN, or Deep Learning) from the dropdown.
   - Click "Get Recommendations".

## Deployment Notes

This project includes multiple recommendation approaches:
KNN-based Model
SVD-based Model
Deep Learning Model [TensorFlow / Keras using Collaborative Filtering (CF)]

⚠️ Due to heavy ML dependencies (TensorFlow, NumPy, SciPy, Surprise), the backend exceeds memory and size limits of free serverless platforms such as Vercel.

## Project Structure
